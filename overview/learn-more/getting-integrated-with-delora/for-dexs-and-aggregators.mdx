### As a DEX or Liquidity Aggregator

DEXs and aggregators must provide a **swap flow and user experience** comparable to protocols already integrated into Delora.

Integrations must fit Delora’s existing execution and routing flow and follow patterns that can be handled reliably by the platform.

---

## Architectural Limitations

Currently, Delora does **not** support integrations for:

- limit orders
- order books
- RFQ-based execution
- intent-based execution

These limitations are due to constraints in the current backend and smart contract architecture.\
There is **no timeline** for adding support for these execution models.

---

## Existing Aggregator Integrations

If your project is already integrated with aggregators supported by Delora\
(e.g., OKX, Jupiter, OpenOcean), we are **unlikely to integrate it directly**, as your liquidity may already be available through existing routing paths.

---

## DEX & Aggregator Integration Requirements

---

### Uniswap V2 / Uniswap V3 Forks

We can efficiently integrate DEXs and aggregators based on **Uniswap V2 or Uniswap V3–compatible architectures** within a short period of time.

To proceed with the integration, the following information must be provided\
**for each chain** on which your protocol operates:

```json
{
  "name": "ExampleDEX",
  "chainId": 100,
  "webUrl": "https://app.exampledex.xyz",
  "tokenlistUrl": "https://tokens.exampledex.xyz",
  "routerAddress": "0x...",
  "factoryAddress": "0x...",
  "initCodeHash": "0x...",
  "baseTokens": [
    {
      "address": "0x...",
      "symbol": "TOKEN",
      "decimals": 18
    }
  ]
}
```

**Logo requirements:**

- minimum size: **300 × 300 px**
- white or transparent background

---

### Non-Uniswap-Compatible Protocols

If your DEX or aggregator is **not compatible with Uniswap V2 or V3**, an **API-based integration** is required.

Please provide documentation and ensure the following technical standards are met:

- ability to handle **at least 1 request per second**
- clear and legible error messages
- **average API response time below 2 seconds**

---

### Additional Requirements

All DEX and aggregator integrations must:

- maintain an active support channel
- remain responsive throughout the integration process and beyond
- provide a **stable API** without breaking changes
- give at least **3 weeks’ notice** before any updates
