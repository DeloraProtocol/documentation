## Getting Integrated by Delora

Delora is a neutral, multi-chain execution layer focused on integrating reliable and production-ready protocols.\
We regularly receive integration requests from decentralized exchanges, aggregators, and bridges across multiple ecosystems.

Each new integration increases system complexity and long-term maintenance requirements, which in turn impact our ability to support additional protocols at scale.

---

## Integration Approach and Prioritization

Delora’s integration roadmap is driven by actual demand from existing integrators and applications.

We prioritize integrations based on:

- demand from Delora integrators
- protocol maturity and production usage
- execution predictability
- long-term maintainability

All integrations are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

## To Get the Integration Started

If your protocol is selected for integration, you will be required to meet the technical and operational requirements outlined below for [**DEXs & Aggregators**](/overview/learn-more/getting-integrated-with-delora/for-dexs-and-aggregators) or [**Bridges**](/overview/learn-more/getting-integrated-with-delora/Bridges).

To initiate the process, please contact the Delora team to discuss integration feasibility.
