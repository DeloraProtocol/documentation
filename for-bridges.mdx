## Overview

Integrating a new bridge requires significant effort, including backend and smart contract implementation, thorough testing, and a deep understanding of protocol-specific edge cases.

Given the volume of traffic routed through Delora, we also perform stress testing and optimize each integration, including identifying data that can be safely cached to improve performance.

---

Integration prioritization for bridges is strictly driven by the needs of Delora’s existing enterprise and infrastructure partners.

Despite having dedicated resources, accommodating additional bridge integrations remains challenging.\
As a result, our capacity to onboard new bridges is limited and subject to these priorities.

## Strategies to Improve Your Chances of Integration

To increase the likelihood of being integrated into Delora, consider the following:

- **Demonstrate performance advantages**\
  Provide data showing that your bridge outperforms at least one of the top bridges currently used within the Delora ecosystem.
- **Align with existing API standards**\
  Ensure your API closely matches the structure of already integrated bridges, including endpoints, inputs, and outputs.\
  This alignment enables a more straightforward integration process by allowing Delora to adapt existing integration logic with minimal changes.

A list of currently supported bridges and networks can be found in the Delora documentation.
