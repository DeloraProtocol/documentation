Delora is building infrastructure that enables developers to embed cross-chain swaps directly into their applications. Unlock new revenue streams and deep analytics.

Instead of integrating bridges, DEXes, aggregators, token lists, RPCs, relayers, and fail-safes one by one, an app connects to Delora once, via API, and gets multi-chain swaps and transfers out of the box.

What Delora does:

- **Base-price routing** \
  Delora aggregates liquidity across chains and sources into a single routing layer. Applications achieve the best execution route through a single API, eliminating the need for individual DEXes, bridges, or RPCs.
- **Standardizes execution** \
  One execution model, one way to build flows, one place to handle errors. We abstract gas models, nonces, token formats, and per-chain quirks behind a consistent abstraction.
- **Monetization and analytics** \
  Through the [Partner Portal](http://portal.delora.build/), teams get detailed analytics on volumes, users, routes, and fees, and can configure their own fee structure and revenue share. Cross-chain execution becomes a measurable, controllable revenue stream instead of pure infrastructure cost.

For the app, this turns “months of cross-chain infrastructure work” into “one integration that takes hours”.\
Delora lets teams focus on their core product while we handle liquidity, routing, execution, and the surrounding operational layer.

### **Use Cases**

- **Wallets & Superapps** \
  Embed same-chain swaps and cross-chain flows with one integration. Offer users “swap anything, move anywhere” UX while Delora handles routing and on-chain execution behind the scenes.
- **DeFi & Consumer Apps** \
  Power in-app swaps, bridging, and multi-step flows (swap → bridge) with predictable execution. Ship new chains and tokens without rebuilding your infrastructure.
- **Account Abstraction Apps** \
  Use Delora as your execution layer for batched and programmable flows. Add gas sponsorship or session-based UX on top (coming soon) without changing your core integration.
- **Fiat Off/On Ramp** \
  Plug in Delora to let users swap into any token and receive it on the target chain in one flow.
- **Build anything, anywhere** \
  Design bridges, agents, vaults, or automation flows on top of Delora’s secure, unified execution layer — flexible enough for any system, scalable for any use case.

## Our Principles

At Delora, we follow a set of core principles that guide how we design, build, and operate:

- **Security-first** \
  Every transaction runs through transparent contracts with deterministic outcomes. If it can’t settle exactly as intended, it won’t execute.
- **Modularity** \
  Developers can integrate only what they need; Delora is composable, not monolithic.
- **Simplicity** \
  One API replaces a zoo of integrations and endless maintenance.
- **Scalability** \
  Adding new chains or liquidity providers should be seamless, without breaking existing flows.
- **Transparency** \
  From route selection to settlement, everything is visible and verifiable.
