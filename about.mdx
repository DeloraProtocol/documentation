Delora is building infrastructure that lets developers embed cross-chain swaps directly into their apps. Unlock new revenue streams, and deep analytics.

Instead of integrating bridges, DEXes, aggregators, token lists, RPCs, relayers, and fail-safes one by one, an app connects to Delora once, via API, and gets multi-chain swaps and transfers out of the box.

What Delora does:

- **Base-price routing** — Delora aggregates liquidity across chains and sources into a single routing layer. Applications get the best executable route (price + fees + gas) through one API, without integrating individual DEXes, bridges, or RPCs.
- **Standardizes execution** — One execution model, one way to build flows, one place to handle errors. We hide gas models, nonces, token formats, and per-chain quirks behind a consistent abstraction.
- **Monetization and analytics** — Through the Partner Portal, teams get detailed analytics on volumes, users, routes, and fees, and can configure their own fee structure and revenue share. Cross-chain execution becomes a measurable, controllable revenue stream instead of pure infrastructure cost.

For the app, this turns “months of cross-chain infrastructure work” into “one integration that takes hours or days”.\
Delora lets teams focus on their core product while we handle liquidity, routing, execution, and the surrounding operational layer.

### **Use Cases**

- **Wallets and DeFi platforms** — Embed seamless cross-chain swaps and bridges via a single API. Delora delivers full end-to-end execution — from routing to final transaction — with zero backend complexity.
- **Aggregators and bridges** — Upgrade your routing logic with Delora’s execution layer. Access verified multi-chain routes, off-chain simulations, and deterministic on-chain settlement across 25+ networks.
- **Agentic systems and trading bots** — Run automated cross-chain swaps through pre-validated routes with deterministic outcomes — no blind signing, no failed trades, no unpredictability.
- **Fintech and on-chain infrastructure** — Connect your applications to deep on-chain liquidity for seamless, compliant swaps and bridges powered by transparent, verifiable execution.
- **Build anything, anywhere** — Design bridges, agents, vaults, or automation flows on top of Delora’s secure, unified execution layer — flexible enough for any system, scalable for any use case.

## Our Principles

At Delora, we follow a set of core principles that guide how we design, build, and operate:

- **Security-first** — every transaction runs through transparent contracts with deterministic outcomes. If it can’t settle exactly as intended, it won’t execute.
- **Determinism & Reliability** — execution must always be predictable, repeatable, and failure-tolerant, across any chain or flow.
- **Modularity** — developers should integrate only what they need; Delora is composable, not monolithic.
- **Simplicity** — one API replaces a zoo of integrations and endless maintenance.
- **Scalability** — adding new chains or liquidity providers should be seamless, without breaking existing flows.
- **Transparency** — from route selection to settlement, everything is visible and verifiable.
