This endpoint enables you to request a quote for transferring tokens, whether across chains or within the same chain. It returns detailed information, including an estimated output amount and a "calldata" that can be directly submitted to your wallet. The estimated output amount can be found in the `outputAmount` field.

<Info>
  All Delora APIs don't require an API key by default. An API key is only necessary for accessing higher request limits.
