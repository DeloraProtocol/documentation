### Purpose

`GET /v1/quotes` returns a **quote** for transferring one token to another — either **within one chain** or **cross-chain**.\
The response includes:

- an estimated result (`outputAmount`),
- the selected tool/route (`tool`),
- and a `calldata[]` array you can pass directly to a wallet for execution.

**Base URL:** `https://api.delora.build/v1` (HTTPS only)

### Endpoint

**GET** `/v1/quotes`

#### Query Parameters

| Name                  | Type   | Required | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `originChainId`       | number | ✅        | Chain ID of the **sending** chain.                                         |
| `destinationChainId`  | number | ✅        | Chain ID of the **receiving** chain.                                       |
| `originCurrency`      | string | ✅        | Token address on `originChainId`.                                          |
| `destinationCurrency` | string | ✅        | Token address on `destinationChainId`.                                     |
| `senderAddress`       | string | ✅        | Sending wallet address.                                                    |
| `receiverAddress`     | string |          | Receiving wallet address. **`If omitted, senderAddress is used.`**         |
| `amount`              | string | ✅        | Amount **in smallest units** (e.g., `1000000` for 1 USDC with 6 decimals). |
| `integrator`          | string |          | Free-form identifier for the API integrator.                               |

> **Format notes:**\
> – Use canonical addresses for the given chain.\
> – `amount` is always specified in the **smallest units** (token decimals applied).

### Response

JSON containing the estimate and the transaction data.

| Field          | Type     | Required | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputAmount`  | string   | ✅        | Input amount (smallest units) mirrors the requested `amount`.   |
| `outputAmount` | string   | ✅        | **Estimated** amount of the destination token (smallest units). |
| `tool`         | string   | ✅        | Tool/route used for the transfer.                               |
| `calldata`     | object[] | ✅        | An array of transaction objects suitable for a wallet/provider. |
| `fees`         | object[] |          | Fees are included in the transfer.                              |

> **Note:** This is a **quote** (estimate), not a guaranteed execution result. Final settlement can differ due to the on-chain state at broadcast time. Use appropriate constraints if included in the returned `calldata`.

### Example Request

```http
GET https://api.delora.build/v1/quotes
  ?originChainId=1
  &destinationChainId=42161
  &originCurrency=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48
  &destinationCurrency=0xFF970A61A04b1cA14834A43f5dE4533eBDDB5CC8
  &senderAddress=0xYourSenderAddr
  &receiverAddress=0xYourReceiverAddr
  &amount=1000000
  &integrator=your-app
```

### Example Response (simplified)

```JSON
{
  "inputAmount": "1000000",
  "outputAmount": "998500",
  "tool": "route-identifier",
  "calldata": [
    {
      "to": "0xRouterOrBridgeAddress",
      "data": "0xabcdef...",
      "value": "0x0"
      // additional fields depend on the route/network
    }
  ],
  "fees": [
    { "name": "protocol", "amount": "1500" }
  ]
}
```

### Behavior & Conventions

- **Single interface:** Works for intra-chain and cross-chain transfers.
- **Default receiver:** If `receiverAddress` is not provided, `senderAddress` is used.
- **Denomination:** All amounts are in **smallest units** for their tokens.
- **Execution-ready:** `calldata[]` is returned in a wallet-friendly format.

---

### Auth, Rate Limits, Errors

- The API is accessible **over HTTPS only**.
- See **Rate Limits** and **API Authentication** for key and quota usage.
- Error formats and codes are listed in **Error Codes** (e.g., unsupported chain/pair, invalid addresses, bad `amount`, rate-limit)

---

### Supported Entities

- **Chains** — supported networks and their `chainId`s.
- **Tokens** — supported token lists per chain.
- **Tools** — available tools/routes used by the API (bridges, DEXs, solvers, etc).

---

### High-Level Flow (API level)

1. You supply transfer parameters.
2. The API returns an **estimate** (`outputAmount`) and **execution instructions** (`calldata[]`).
3. You pass `calldata` to a wallet/provider for signing and broadcasting.
