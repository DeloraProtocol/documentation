## Introduction

Delora is an execution layer that aggregates liquidity and abstracts away the complexity of multi-chain interactions. Our system connects dApps with bridges and DEXs through a single API, returning deterministic Execution Packets that are safely executed on-chain. This architecture enables seamless cross-chain and same-chain transactions with built-in monitoring, fallback logic, and transparent smart contracts.

### Key Components of Delora Architecture

#### 1. dApp Integrations

**What it is**: The entry point where users interact.

- **How it works**: dApps plug into Delora’s API to request quotes for swaps or cross-chain transfers. Once the optimal path is chosen, the dApp packages it into a signed Execution Packet and submits it on-chain for processing.

#### 2. Delora Router (Off-chain Routing)

**Purpose**: The off-chain aggregation and routing layer.

**Functions**:

- Collect pricing and routes from integrated bridges and DEXs.
- Determine the optimal path based on cost, speed, and reliability.
- After identifying the optimal route, Delora validates the security of the selected path, ensuring that there are no vulnerabilities or risks before proceeding.
- Encode the chosen route and parameters into an Execution Packet for deterministic settlement.

#### 3. Execution Packet

**Essence**: A structured, signed instruction that defines exactly how a transaction should execute.

**Contents**:

- Full route across liquidity sources.
- Minimum output amounts and deadlines.
- Fee logic.

#### 4. Delora Diamond Contract (On-chain Executor)

**Role**: The primary smart contract entry point for execution.

**Functions**:

- Validate the Execution Packet and signature.
- Route the transaction to the correct facet (bridge/DEX).
- Enforce constraints and trigger fallback if conditions are violated.
- Act as a deterministic state machine for all executions.

#### 5. Delora Facet Contracts

**Feature**: Modular and extensible — new providers can be added without redeploying the system.

- **Bridge Facets**: Connect to supported cross-chain bridges.
- **GenericSwap Facet**: Route same-chain swaps to the best available DEX.

#### 6. Liquidity Provider Contracts

- **Where settlement happens**: Bridges, or DEXs, contracts finalize the trade/transfer.

  **Rule**: Delora enforces deterministic execution — every step must match the encoded packet.

### End-to-End Flow

1. **Request** → The user starts a swap or transfer from a dApp integrated with Delora.
2. **Quote Discovery** → Delora Router queries connected bridges and DEXs to gather pricing and route data.
3. **Packet Creation** → The chosen route (with minOut, deadlines, and fee caps) is encoded into a deterministic **Execution Packet**.
4. **Signature** → The user signs the packet, approving exactly this execution flow.
5. **On-chain Submission** → The signed packet is sent to the **Delora Diamond** contract.
6. **Facet Dispatch** → Delora Diamond validates the packet and forwards execution to the correct **Facet Module** (bridge or DEX).
7. **Settlement** → The liquidity provider’s contract (bridge/DEX) finalizes the swap or transfer.
8. **Outcome** → Execution either completes exactly as specified in the packet.

### Key Differentiators

- **Security-first**: Strict execution rules ensure no undefined outcomes.
- **Unified integration**: One API replaces dozens of fragmented setups.
- **Determinism**: Execution is binary — success or safe fail.
- **Modularity**: Extensible architecture with pluggable facets and providers.
- **Efficiency**: Faster go-to-market with lower maintenance overhead.
