With Delora, developers can earn revenue from every transaction processed through their integration.

Any dApp, wallet, or platform using Delora’s API can define custom fees and automatically collect earnings from user transaction volume.

### How it works

When requesting quotes or executing transactions via the Delora API, you can pass a fee parameter: _0.01 = 1%_

Delora adds this fee to the route, and it is distributed automatically via the Fee Pool infrastructure

### EVM

Fees are accumulated in the Fee Pool smart contract. Only the designated fee wallet can claim accrued fees. Once a wallet is registered, all collected fees are locked to it and cannot be transferred. If you later change the fee wallet, new fees will accrue to the new wallet.

### Other networks (coming soon)

On Solana and Sui, fees will be sent directly to the designated wallet without requiring manual claims.

### Setting up a fee wallet

To start earning fees:

1. Register your integration at [portal.alyra.finance](https://portal.alyra.finance).
2. Link a wallet to collect fees.
3. Provide your integrator String (so fees are tracked correctly).

Through the partner portal, you can monitor fees per chain and per token, and withdraw them.

### Configuring fees

By default, the fees are disabled for integrators. To collect the fee, the "fee" parameter must be specified, along with the "integrator" parameter, before requesting a Quote. (See reference: [Get a quote for a token transfer](https://docs.alyra.finance/api-reference/endpoint/get-a-quote-for-a-token-transfer))

<Note>
  **Example**

  1. An integrator sets a fee = 0.3%
  1. A user makes a \$100,000 cross-chain transfer.
  2. The integrator earns \$300, which can be claimed via the Fee Pool.
</Note>

### Key Benefits for Developers

- **New revenue stream** — earn from every transaction routed through your integration.
- **Flexible configuration** — customise the fee for each transaction.
- **Transparent accounting** — track fees by chain and token.
