title: "Simple vs advanced routing"
---

Delora API provides two ways to request execution paths: **`/quote`** and **`/routes`**. Both endpoints use the same routing engine, but they serve different needs depending on how much control and detail an integrator requires.

---

### `/quote` — Simplified Execution

The `/quote` endpoint is designed for **ease of integration and smooth UX**.

- Returns a single, optimized route (swap, bridge, or a combination).
- Can include **multi-step flows** (e.g., bridge + swap), but the complexity is abstracted away.
- Provides **ready-to-sign transaction data**, so the user only needs to confirm one execution.
- Best choice for dApps that want one-click integration without handling multiple steps.

**🔑 Takeaway**: `/quote` = simple, packaged, and user-friendly. Even complex routes are flattened into one transaction flow.

---

### `/routes` — Advanced Control

The `/routes` endpoint is designed for **flexibility and transparency**.

- Returns multiple possible routes to the same destination.
- Exposes the full structure of the route, including each step (bridge, swap, relayer interaction).
- Requires generating per-step transaction data via `/stepTransaction`.
- Allows developers to implement custom logic such as:
  - fallback routes,
  - per-leg limits (minOut, slippage, deadlines),
  - monitoring and analytics at the step level.

**🔑 Takeaway**: `/routes` = advanced routing for developers who need control over every step.

### When to Use

- Use **`/quote`** when you want the fastest path to integration and a smooth UX — one endpoint, one signature, one execution.
- Use **`/routes`** when you need more flexibility, visibility into all possible paths, or the ability to add custom execution logic.

### Example

- **`With /quote`**:\
  User wants to send USDC from Solana and receive DAI on Base. Delora may internally build a route = _USDC (Solana) → Bridge → USDC (Base) → Swap → DAI (Base)_.\
  The integrator only gets **one packaged transaction** for the user to sign.
- **`With /routes`**:\
  The same request returns **several possible multi-step routes**, e.g.:
  - Route 1: Bridge via Wormhole + Swap on Uniswap.
  - Route 2: Bridge via Stargate + Swap on Curve.
